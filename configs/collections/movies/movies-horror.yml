      back the series, but did poorly. The series centres around Damien Thorn, a
      child born of Satan and given to Robert and Katherine Thorn, before being
      passed along the Thorn families as a child. It is revealed among the
      families that Damien is in fact meant to be the Antichrist, and as an

      When a Stranger Calls is a 1979 American psychological horror film written
      and directed by Fred Walton and co-written by Steve Feke. It stars Carol
      Kane, Colleen Dewhurst, Tony Beckley and Charles Durning. The film derives
      its story from the classic folk legend of "the babysitter and the man
      upstairs." The film has developed a large cult following over time because
      of the first 20 minutes, now consistently regarded as one of the scariest
      openings in movie history. The first 12 minutes of Wes Craven's Scream is
      an homage to the opening of When a Stranger Calls. The film was released
      in the United States on October 26, 1979, by Columbia Pictures. It was
      commercially successful, grossing $21,411,158 at the box office. It
      received a mixed critical reception, with many praising the opening scene
      and performances, but criticism for its writing and lack of scares. It was
      followed by the 1993 made-for-cable sequel When a Stranger Calls Back and
      a remake in 2006.

      The Wicker Man is a series of two horror films directed by British author
      and director Robin Hardy. The films are not directly linked to one
      another, but all deal with the theme of paganism in the modern world. The
      2006 American remake of The Wicker Man is not a part of the series, and
      Hardy had dissociated himself from it.
