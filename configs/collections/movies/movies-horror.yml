        The Zombi Collection is a series of Italian zombie films. The series
        began with the 1979 release of Zombi 2 directed by Lucio Fulci. It was
        adapted from an original screenplay by Dardano Sacchetti to serve as a
        sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978), which was released
        in Italy with the title Zombi. This was followed in 1988 with Zombi 3,
        which is an in-name-only sequel to Fulci's Zombi 2. Claudio Fragasso
        then directed 1989's After Death, which was retitled Zombi 4 by its
        Japanese video distributors. Finally, Killing Birds is a 1988 Italian
        horror film starring Lara Wendel and Robert Vaughn which was renamed
        Zombi 5 by distributors.
