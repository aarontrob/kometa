        Peanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written
        and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz that ran from October 2, 1950, to
        February 13, 2000, and continuing in reruns afterward. Peanuts is among
        the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with
        17,897 strips published in all, making it "arguably the longest story
        ever told by one human being". By the time of Schulz's death in 2000,
        Peanuts ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of around 355
        million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages. It helped
        to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States,
        and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion.

        Peanuts focuses entirely on a social circle of young children, where
        adults exist but are never seen and rarely heard. The main character,
        Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence. He is unable
        to fly a kite, win a baseball game, or kick a football held by his
        irascible friend Lucy, who always pulls it away at the last instant.

        Peanuts is one of the literate strips with philosophical, psychological,
        and sociological overtones that flourished in the 1950s. Peanuts's humor
        is psychologically complex and driven by the characters' interactions
        and relationships.
