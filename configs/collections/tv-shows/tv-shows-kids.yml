      Peanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written and
      illustrated by Charles M. Schulz that ran from October 2, 1950, to
      February 13, 2000, and continuing in reruns afterward. Peanuts is among
      the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with
      17,897 strips published in all, making it "arguably the longest story ever
      told by one human being". By the time of Schulz's death in 2000, Peanuts
      ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of around 355 million in
      75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement
      the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States, and
      together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion.

      Peanuts focuses entirely on a social circle of young children, where
      adults exist but are never seen and rarely heard. The main character,
      Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence. He is unable
