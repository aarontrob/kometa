        The story revolves around three single roommates: Janet Wood, Chrissy
        Snow and Jack Tripper who all platonically share Apartment 201 in a
        Santa Monica, California apartment building owned by Mr. and Mrs. Roper.
        Later, following Suzanne Somers's departure, Jenilee Harrison joined the
        cast as Cindy Snow, who was later replaced by Priscilla Barnes as Terri
        Alden. After the Ropers were spun-off into their own sitcom, Don Knotts
        joined the cast as the roommates' new landlord Ralph Furley, brother of
        the new building owner, Bart Furley.

        The show, a comedy of errors, chronicles the escapades and hijinks of
        the trio's constant misunderstandings, social lives, and struggle to
        keep up with the rent.
