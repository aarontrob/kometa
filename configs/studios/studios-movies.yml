        Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment (founded and formerly known as
        Videocraft International, Ltd. and Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc.) was an
        American production company known for its seasonal television specials,
        usually done in stop motion animation. Rankin/Bass' stop-motion
        productions are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like
        characters with spheroid body parts and ubiquitous powdery snow using an
        animation technique called "Animagic". Often, traditional cel animation
        scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the
        effect of a snowfall.
