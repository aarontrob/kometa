      person: Adam Sandler
      summary: >-
        Adam Richard Sandler (born September 9, 1966) is an American comedian,
        actor, and filmmaker. He was a cast member on Saturday Night Live from
        1990 to 1995, before going on to star in many Hollywood films, which
        have combined to earn more than $2 billion at the box office. Sandler
        had an estimated net worth of $420 million in 2020, and signed a further
        four-movie deal with Netflix worth over $250 million.

        Sandler's comedic roles include Billy Madison (1995), Happy Gilmore
        (1996), The Waterboy (1998), The Wedding Singer (1998), Big Daddy
        (1999), Mr. Deeds (2002), 50 First Dates (2004), The Longest Yard
        (2005), Click (2006), Grown Ups (2010), Just Go with It (2011), Grown
        Ups 2 (2013), Blended (2014), Murder Mystery (2019) and Hubie Halloween

        and Dracula in the first three films of the Hotel Transylvania franchise
        (2012–2018).

        While some of his comedic films, including Jack and Jill (2011), have
        been panned, resulting in Sandler receiving nine Golden Raspberry Awards
        and 37 Raspberry Award nominations, more than any actor other than
        Sylvester Stallone, he has received critical acclaim for his dramatic
        performances in the dramedy films Spanglish (2004), Reign Over Me
        (2007), and Funny People (2009). He has also been roundly praised for
        his leading roles in auteur films including Punch-Drunk Love (2002) by
        Paul Thomas Anderson, Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories (2017), and
        the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems (2019), the last of which earned him the
        Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.

  Alfred Hitchcock:
    template:
      name: People - Trakt List
      list: alfred-hitchcock-collection
      summary: >-
        Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, KBE (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980), was
        an English director and producer. Labeled as the "Master of Suspense",
        he became known for thrillers, often combined with a dark sense of
        humor. After a successful career in his native country, Hitchcock moved
        to Hollywood in 1939. Over a career spanning more than half a century,
        Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognizable
        directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a
        way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of
        voyeurism. He framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and
        used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives
        on the run from the law alongside icy blonde female characters. Many of
        Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring
        depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the
        mysteries function as decoys —or MacGuffins— meant only to serve
        thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological
        examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many
        themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through
        his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and
        the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1965), he became
        a cultural icon.

        Hitchcock is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in
        the history of cinema. In 2002, Hitchcock was ranked 2nd behind Orson
        Welles in the critics' top ten poll in the list of The Greatest
        Directors of All Time compiled by the Sight & Sound magazine. Andrew
        Sarris in his influential book of film criticism The American Cinema:
        Directors and Directions 1929–1968 included him in the "pantheon" of the
        14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States.

        Hitchcock's critically most acclaimed film is the psychological thriller
        film Vertigo (1958). Although being a mild failure upon its release, it
        has risen in popularity over the decades. In 2012 it even replaced Orson
        Welles' Citizen Kane as the greatest film ever made in the Sight & Sound
        critics' poll. Regarding visual style, Vertigo is often declared as
        Hitchcock's most perfect film. The use of color symbolism, meticulously
        composed shots, and the famous "Vertigo effect" (dolly zoom) continue to
        be studied and admired.

        Hitchcock's most commercially successful and most famous film is Psycho
        (1960), which had a significant impact on the horror genre, especially
        the slasher film. Hitchcock was able to prove his skills with the
        mystery thriller film Rear Window (1954), to create suspense within a
        confined setting - primarily the protagonist's apartment. In this film,
        voyeurism, one of Hitchcock's favorite subjects, is an essential aspect.

        Many of Hitchcock's spy films, most notably North by Northwest (1959)
        and Notorious (1946), had a major impact on the Mission: Impossible and
        James Bond series.

        Charles “Charlie” Chaplin (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an
        English comic actor, film director and composer best-known for his work
        during the silent film era. He used mime, slapstick and other visual
        comedy routines, and continued well into the era of the talkies, though
        his films decreased in frequency by the end of the 1920s. His most
        famous role was that of The Tramp, which he first played in Kid Auto
        Races (1914). From 1914 onwards he was writing and directing most of his
        films, by 1916 he was producing them, and by 1918 he was also composing
        the music for them. In 1919 he co-founded United Artists. In 1999, the

  Clint Eastwood:

      summary: >-
        Clinton "Clint" Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American film
        actor, director, producer, composer and former politician. Following his
        breakthrough role on the TV series "Rawhide" (1959–65), Eastwood starred
        as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti
        westerns ("A Fistful of Dollars," "For a Few Dollars More," and "The
        Good, the Bad and the Ugly") in the 1960s, and as San Francisco Police
        Department Inspector Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry films ("Dirty
        Harry," "Magnum Force," "The Enforcer," "Sudden Impact," and "The Dead
        Pool") during the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, along with several
        others in which he plays tough-talking no-nonsense police officers, have
        made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.

        Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Producer of the Best
        Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor, for his work
        in the films "Unforgiven" (1992) and "Million Dollar Baby" (2004). These
        films in particular, as well as others including "Play Misty for Me"
        (1971), "The Outlaw Josey Wales" (1976), "Pale Rider" (1985), "In the
        Line of Fire" (1993), "The Bridges of Madison County" (1995), and "Gran
        Torino" (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical
        acclaim. Eastwood's only comedies have been "Every Which Way but Loose"
        (1978) and its sequel "Any Which Way You Can" (1980); despite being
        widely panned by critics they are the two highest-grossing films of his
        career after adjusting for inflation.

        Eastwood has directed most of his own star vehicles, but he has also
        directed films in which he did not appear such as "Mystic River" (2003)
        and "Letters from Iwo Jima" (2006), for which he received Academy Award
        nominations and "Changeling" (2008), which received Golden Globe Award
        nominations. He has received considerable critical praise in France in
        particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the
        United States, and was awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994
        he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was
        awarded the Légion d'honneur medal. In 2000 he was awarded the Italian
        Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement.

        Since 1967 Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which
        has produced the vast majority of his films. He also served as the
        nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988.
        Eastwood has seven children by five women, although he has only married
        twice. An audiophile, Eastwood is also associated with jazz and has
        composed and performed pieces in several films along with his eldest
        son, Kyle Eastwood.

        Acclaimed American writer born Theodor Seuss Geisel (March 2, 1904 –
        September 24, 1991) was an American children's author and cartoonist. He
        is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under
        the pen name Dr. Seuss. His work includes many of the most popular
        children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being
        translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death.

        After attending Dartmouth College and Oxford University, he began a
        career in advertising. His advertising cartoons, featuring Quick, Henry,
        the Flit!, appeared in several leading American magazines. Dr. Seuss's
        first children's book, titled "And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry
        Street", hit the market in 1937, changing the face of children's
        literature forever. It was rejected 27 times before it was finally

  Elvis Presley:

      title: 'Elvis: That''s the Way It Is'
      summary: >-
        Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), or simply
        Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and
        Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of
        the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually
        provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of
        influences across color lines during a transformative era in race
        relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.

        Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis,
        Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career
        began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam
        Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a
        wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by
        lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of
        rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and
        rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the
        lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract
        in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more
        than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel",
        was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United
        States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With
        a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping
        records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of
        rock and roll, though his performative style and promotion of the
        then-marginalized sound of African-Americans led to him being widely
        considered a threat to the moral well-being of the White American youth.

        In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted
        into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career
        two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He
        held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote
        much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most
        of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included
        Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In
        1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned
        to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which
        led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly
        profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo
        artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of
        prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised
        his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the
        age of 42.

        Francis Albert "Frank" Sinatra ( December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was
        an American singer and actor. Beginning his musical career in the swing
        era with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a successful solo
        artist in the early to mid-1940s, being the idol of the "bobby soxers".

        His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in
        1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (for his
        performance in From Here to Eternity). He signed with Capitol Records
        and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small
        Hours, Songs for Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly with Me, Only the Lonely and
        Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label,
        Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding,
        Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim),
        toured internationally, was a founding member of the Rat Pack and
        fraternized with celebrities and statesmen, including John F. Kennedy.

        Sinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My
        Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A
        Man and His Music, and scored hits with "Strangers in the Night" and "My
        Way". With sales of his music dwindling and after appearing in several
        poorly received films, Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971. Two
        years later, however, he came out of retirement and in 1973 recorded
        several albums, scoring a Top 40 hit with "(Theme From) New York, New
        York" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both
        within the United States and internationally, until a short time before
        his death in 1998.

        Sinatra also forged a successful career as a film actor, winning the
        Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here
        to Eternity, a nomination for Best Actor for The Man with the Golden
        Arm, and critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian
        Candidate. He also starred in such musicals as High Society, Pal Joey,
        Guys and Dolls and On the Town. Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy
        Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
        by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997.
        Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the
        Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime
        Achievement Award.

        James Eugene Carrey (born January 17, 1962) is a Canadian and American
        actor, comedian, writer, and producer. Known for his energetic slapstick
        performances, Carrey first gained recognition in 1990, after landing a
        recurring role in the American sketch comedy television series In Living
        Color (1990–1994). He broke out as a star in motion pictures with Ace
        Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, and Dumb and Dumber (all 1994). This
        was followed up with Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Batman Forever
        (both 1995), and Liar Liar (1997).

        In the 2000s, he gained further notice for his portrayal of the Grinch
        in How the Grinch Stole Christmas and for the comedy Me, Myself & Irene
        (both in 2000), as well as Bruce Almighty (2003), Lemony Snicket's A
        Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), Fun with Dick and Jane (2005), Yes
        Man, Horton Hears a Who! (both 2008), and A Christmas Carol (2009). In

        in six episodes of Saturday Night Live in the leadup to the 2020 United
        States presidential election.

        Although largely typecast as a comedic actor, Carrey has had success in
        dramatic roles. His first dramatic success was starring in the
        Emmy-nominated made-for-television film Doing Time on Maple Drive
        (1992). Carrey gained attention for his leading roles in The Truman Show
        (1998) and Man on the Moon (1999), earning Golden Globe Awards for each
        film. He later starred in the psychological science fiction romantic
        drama film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004); this
        performance is repeatedly lauded as one of the most important and
        seminal in Carrey's career and for which he was nominated for both the
        BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and another Golden Globe
        Award. He was also praised for his dramatic role of Jeff Piccirillo in
        the Showtime tragicomedy series Kidding, for which he was nominated for
        another Golden Globe. The Guardian named him one of the best actors
        never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

  Laurel & Hardy:

      list: laurel-hardy
      summary: >-
        Laurel and Hardy were a British-American comedy team during the early
        Classical Hollywood era of American cinema, consisting of Englishman
        Stan Laurel (1890–1965) and American Oliver Hardy (1892–1957). Starting
        their career as a duo in the silent film era, they later successfully
        transitioned to "talkies". From the late 1920s to the mid-1950s, they
        were internationally famous for their slapstick comedy, with Laurel
        playing the clumsy, childlike friend to Hardy's pompous bully. Their
        signature theme song, known as "The Cuckoo Song", "Ku-Ku", or "The Dance
        of the Cuckoos" (by Hollywood composer T. Marvin Hatley) was heard over
        their films' opening credits, and became as emblematic of them as their
        bowler hats.

        Prior to emerging as a team, both had well-established film careers.
        Laurel had acted in over 50 films, and worked as a writer and director,
        while Hardy was in more than 250 productions. Both had appeared in The
        Lucky Dog (1921), but were not teamed at the time. They first appeared
        together in a short film in 1926, when they signed separate contracts
        with the Hal Roach film studio. They officially became a team in 1927
        when they appeared in the silent short Putting Pants on Philip. They
        remained with Roach until 1940, and then appeared in eight B movie
        comedies for 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1941 to 1945.
        After finishing their film commitments at the end of 1944, they
        concentrated on performing stage shows, and embarked on a music hall
        tour of England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.[4] They made their last
        film in 1950, a French–Italian co-production called Atoll K.

        They appeared as a team in 107 films, starring in 32 short silent films,
        40 short sound films, and 23 full-length feature films. They also made
        12 guest or cameo appearances, including in the Galaxy of Stars
        promotional film of 1936. On December 1, 1954, they made their sole
        American television appearance, when they were surprised and interviewed
        by Ralph Edwards on his live NBC-TV program This Is Your Life. Since the
        1930s, their works have been released in numerous theatrical reissues,
        television revivals, 8-mm and 16-mm home movies, feature-film
        compilations, and home videos. In 2005, they were voted the
        seventh-greatest comedy act of all time by a UK poll of professional
        comedians. The official Laurel and Hardy appreciation society is The
        Sons of the Desert, after a fictional fraternal society in the film of
        the same name.
  Marilyn Monroe:

      summary: >-
        Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; 1 June 1926 – 4 August 1962)
        was an American actress. Famous for playing comedic "blonde bombshell"
        characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s
        and early 1960s, as well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution.
        She was a top-billed actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200
        million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021) by the time of her death in
        1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a major icon of pop culture.
        In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her sixth on their list of
        the greatest female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood.
        Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Monroe as one of the
        best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

        Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in a
        total of 12 foster homes and an orphanage; she married at age sixteen.
        She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a
        photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful
        pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film contracts with
        20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film
        roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next
        two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies,
        including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas
        Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. She faced a scandal when it
        was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to becoming a
        star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in
        increased interest in her films.

        By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had
        leading roles in the film noir Niagara, which overtly relied on her sex
        appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a
        Millionaire, which established her star image as a "dumb blonde". The
        same year, her nude images were used as the centerfold and on the cover
        of the first issue of Playboy. She played a significant role in the
        creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but
        she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the studio.
        She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but
        returned to star in The Seven Year Itch (1955), one of the biggest box
        office successes of her career.

        When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she
        founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to
        building the company and began studying method acting under Lee
        Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new
        contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her
        subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop
        (1956) and her first independent production in The Prince and the
        Showgirl (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in
        Some Like It Hot (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last
        completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961).

        announcements over the public address system in disguised voices. He
